=========

A demo project to learn how to setup:
 * Frontend (React)
 * Backend (Express)
 * Database (MySQL)

And to deploy, Frontend to Netlify and Backend to Heroku.

## Branches

#### Inspired by gitflow.

 * `master`: This is the production branch.
 * `develop`: This is where we all merge are stuff together before it goes to prod.
 * Working branches: We will use a naming convention like this `matt/mything`. These are our personal branches for doing our own development work.

#### The rules:

 * `master`: Must be clean, tests passing, software working correctly.
 * `develop`: Should almost always be clean, tests passing, software working correctly. Avoid breaking develop unless it is absolutely necessary to get through some huge refactor or whatever.
 * `yourname/yourthing`: Do whatever you want, break it fix it, whatever.

#### Deleting Branches:

 It is not recommended to delete any branches, until/unless the total number of branches is truly problematic.
